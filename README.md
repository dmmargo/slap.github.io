Hello!  Welcome to my app!

Summary: 
I've created a decision making app. The app should have different kinds of decision-making factors. For example, 8-ball, jar picking, dice rolling, etc. The problem it is solving is decision making. Every day, people decide on things. I want to make something that will help people decide on which food to get, what League of Legends Champion they want to play that day, etc. My main objective is to help people decide on, for example, what food theyâ€™re going to have that day because of their indecisiveness.
